# Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the behavior of individual components, functions, and classes in isolation.

## Guidelines

- Each source file should have a corresponding test file
- Mock all external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests fast and focused on a single behavior

**Placeholder:** Unit test files will be added during feature implementation.
