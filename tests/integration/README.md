# Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly.

## Guidelines

- Test API endpoints with database interactions
- Test service-to-service communications
- Use test databases (not production)
- Verify data persistence and retrieval
- Test authentication and authorization flows

**Placeholder:** Integration test files will be added during feature implementation.
