# End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify complete user workflows from start to finish.

## Guidelines

- Test critical business processes
- Simulate real user interactions
- Use staging or test environments
- Keep test suite focused on most important flows
- Run before production deployments

**Placeholder:** E2E test files will be added during feature implementation.
